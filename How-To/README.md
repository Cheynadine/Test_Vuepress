## What is GitHub?
GitHub is an online platform that lets developers collaborate efficiently by letting users view, access, and edit the codes of their projects.

## Git Terms
- **Clone** - A copy of the repository from your computer.
- **Repository** - The main folder that contains the project
- **Branch** - Serves as another version of the main project. This is to prevent making sudden changes to the main branch.
- **Pull** - Getting the updated code of the repository.
- **Push** - Updating the repository with the changes you made to the code.
- **Commit** - Saving your work without pushing it to the repository.
- **Merge** - Merging the changes from another branch to another branch.



## Steps

### Go to the link of the repository you want to clone
For this example, we're going to clone [`this repository`](https://github.com/linhe0x0/vuepress-theme-api) that contains one of Vuepress' themes named **API**.
